## Manuscript: Frailty progression following severe infections: a matched cohort study in US Veterans aged 65+ years

This repository hosts the data analysis process, activities for generating publication-ready results/outputs for this study.

### Objectives

  1.	Estimate the association between severe infections after age 65 years and subsequent frailty decline over time, in US Veterans aged ≥65 years.
  2.	Investigate whether the association between severe infections after age 65 years and subsequent frailty decline over time is modified by age group at first severe infection after age 65 years, dementia, HIV, diabetes or comorbidity burden in US Veterans aged ≥65 years.
  3.	Determine whether the pathogen type of the first severe infection after age 65 years (i.e., bacterial, viral, parasitic, or fungal) is associated with a faster decline in frailty in US Veterans aged ≥65 years. 

### Outcome(s): Frailty (VACS Index 2.0 score) at follow-up: Year 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

### Exposure(s): Severe infection after age 65 years (yes, no): any infection (i.e., bacterial, viral, parasitic and fungal infections) which is the principal diagnosis of hospital admission after the age of 65 years, based on the 9th and 10th revisions of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD-9/10) diagnostic coding in hospital records.

### Confounders: 

  - Baseline frailty score 
  - Matching variables (age, sex, ethnicity/race, GP site)
  - Life style variables (smoking, alcohol consumption, alcohol use disorder)
  - Deprivation variables (area deprivation index, rural urban residence type)
  - Look back outpatient infections and commodities
